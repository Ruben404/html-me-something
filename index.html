        <article>	The article, “The Duel”, is written by Joseph J. Ellis. Ellis is an American historian that has written several books about early American history and the people in it. One of the books he’s written is “Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation, which is the book from which this article is excerpted. 
            The article itself, goes over the duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. The duel, where each shot a pistol at each other, started when Burr challenged Hamilton and they arranged a time and place; one away from the general populace, since duels were illegal. They each fired a shot at each other; Hamilton, then Burr. Hamilton missed, and Burr fired a fatal shot. There have been several speculations over this event and how it came about to be. Ellis adds to this story other elements; previous events that led to the duel.
            In Ellis’ article, he proceeds to state and clarify two argued stories of the event. The first, called the Hamiltonian version, was in favor of Hamilton, saying Burr fired first with malicious intent as Hamilton raised his gun, and that Hamilton’s gun fired as a reflex but aimed away from Burr. Ellis then states that this story contradicts the actual events for two reasons. One reason, being that they both followed a code of honor, know as the “code duello”, and agreed to fire separately in turns. The second, more convincing reason, is that two separate shots were heard by the people that accompanied them. According to Ellis, there was a four to five second interval in-between shots, meaning Burr couldn’t have shot first. These two facts support the second story; Burr’s version. At this point, Ellis restates that Hamilton did not have the intent to shoot Burr, but rather shoot and miss intentionally. Hamilton was motivated by the code of honor to miss his shot rather than waste it; not shoot at all. In the Burr version, Hamilton shoots first and Burr flinches, which Van Ness, one of the people that had accompanied Burr, had clarified that the flinch was because of “a stone or piece of wood at his feet” that had injured him. After Hamilton’s shot, Pendleton, one of the people that accompanied Hamilton, counted off the next shot, following the fact of the spaced-out shots. 
            Here, Ellis asks two questions to add on to the story. “First, how does one explain Hamilton’s obviously sincere conviction, delivered to Hosack and Pendleton in the boat afterward, that he had never fired his pistol? And second, if Hamilton did fire at Burr, how does one account for the severed branch so high above and off to the side of Burr’s position?”
            Ellis takes a factual approach to the matter. He states that previous stories could not be completed without distorting the events or the other side of the story. Ellis says that both if these stories “misrepresent what, in all likelihood, really happened.” Ellis’ claim is that Hamilton fired, intentionally missing Burr, and hit a tree branch behind him. Burr didn’t know of Hamilton’s intent to missed, so he fired aiming at Hamilton, following the “code duello”, and therefore justified.
            Ellis goes further and searches through past events that could have led up to “The Duel” happening. He points out that it wouldn’t make sense for Burr to maliciously kill Hamilton, because there would be no gain from his death, and he would’ve lost a great deal of reputation, which he did. The information Ellis adds is that of Hamilton’s and Burr’s verbal exchanges. During the time that Burr was running for governor of New York, Hamilton had made a remark that has not been recovered. What was recovered was Dr. Charles Cooper’s remark about it that Ellis provides and quotes: “I could detail to you a still more despicable opinion which General HAMILTON has expressed of Mr. BURR.” Ellis states the biggest offence in this statement is the word “despicable.” Because of the offence Hamilton made to Burr, Burr wanted Hamilton to either “explain or to disavow the word.” According to Ellis, because there was no evidence of Hamilton saying anything of the sort about Burr, that he could have simply denied saying anything at all. But Hamilton’s course of action was roundabout. Ellis quotes that Hamilton explains he could not “without manifest impropriety, make the avowal or disavowal you seem to think necessary.” Hamilton states that he cannot give a an apology that corresponds to the gravity of the offence because the gravity of the offense is not known. Letters between Hamilton and Burr continued until the point of their duel. At one point, Ellis states, Burr spoke directly with Hamilton to stop speaking badly of him. Despite this, Hamilton did not stop, and Burr concluded that Hamilton would not change. This pushed the event of the duel forward.
            Ellis concludes that Hamilton could not refuse Burr’s challenge without essentially admitting that he was in the wrong, and therefore chose to participate but miss on purpose. Burr, while having sufficient reason to kill Hamilton during the duel, did not do so intentionally and merely followed the “code duello.”
            Ellis’ conclusion is found rationally and factually. He has presented arguments and stories from both sides, as well as using points from both to prove his own point. By using all presented evidence and perspectives, Ellis’ own conclusion is unbiased.
            Ellis, article is straight forward and to the point. He presents the topic, presents existing arguments, and presents his own. This make his work easy to understand. One of the most helpful things about the article is the structure. It evenly separates different segments of the topic; he covers one topic fully, and then the next. However, the least helpful thing is its visual appeal; it can be easy to get lost in the text if you are not familiar with it. It was interesting to be presented with the basic story first, however it wasn’t very interesting for me to have to find my placement in the text over and over again. Regardless, I would highly recommend this article to anyone writing about it. Despite some structural flaws, it is still much easier to read than some other works, and it is very straight forward.
